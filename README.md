# EQ Works Product Dev Intern Work Sample

This project was created for submission for the EQ Works Product Dev Internship. This project implements a basic fixed window rate-limiter on the back-end, and a functional data table on the front end which allows users to filter through various data points and view data supplied by the various API endpoints.

The back-end (API) is hosted on [Heroku](https://eqworks-api.herokuapp.com/) and the front-end is hosted on [Netlify](https://eqworks-client.netlify.com/).
